My solutions to the exercises in the book "The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition" (1988) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

1. A Tutorial Introduction (24/24)
2. Types, Operators, and Expressions (10/10)
3. Control Flow (6/6)
4. Functions and Program Structure (14/14)
5. Pointers and Arrays (20/20)
6. Structures (6/6)
7. Input and Output (9/9)
8. The UNIX System Interface (8/8)

And my own implementation of the meat of the book.

- bsearch     binary search
- dcl         recursive descent parser
- fopen       buffered file functions in <stdio.h>
- malloc      memory allocator
- qsort       quick sort
