My solutions to the exercises in the book "The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition" (1988) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

1. A Tutorial Introduction (24/24)
2. Types, Operators, and Expressions (10/10)
3. Control Flow (6/6)
4. Functions and Program Structure (14/14)
5. Pointes and Arrays (20/20)
6. Structures (6/6)
7. Input and Output (9/9)
8. The UNIX System Interface (8/8)

And, the meat of the book, in my own words --

- bsearch: binary search
- dcl: a recursive descent parser
- malloc: a memory allocator
- qsort: quick sort
