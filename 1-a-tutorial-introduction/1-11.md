**Exercise 1-11.** How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

**Answer:** For an output with 3 values: number of lines (`nl`), number of words (`nw`), and number of characters (`nc`), test with

| input                               | expected output |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| empty input                         | `0 0 0`         |
| `[TAB][ENTER]`                      | `1 0 2`         |
| `a[ENTER]`                          | `1 1 2`         |
| `I'm[ENTER]`                        | `1 1 4`         |
| `[TAB]1[TAB][TAB]2[TAB][ENTER]`     | `1 2 7`         |
| `[ENTER][ENTER]`                    | `2 0 2`         |
| `[ENTER][TAB]1[ENTER]2[TAB][ENTER]` | `3 2 7`         |

In general, boundary values such as

- empty input,
- empty lines,
- lines with only blanks and tabs,
- lines with only one word, which may have leading and trailing blanks and tabs

are most likely to uncover bugs.
